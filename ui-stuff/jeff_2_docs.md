## Getting started
### Quirks and cool features
Jeff 2 is unique and unlike most ui libraries. The biggest difference is that it is *event based*.

Instead of making a toggle like this...
```lua
ui:NewToggle("Hello world", function(state) print(state) end)
```
you would make it like this...
```lua
local toggle = ui:NewToggle("Hello world")
toggle.OnToggle:Connect(function(state) 
    print(state)
end)
```
This doesn't seem like that big of a difference, right? The callback is just a line down!

However, this is more powerful than it seems. It lets you organize your code better, disconnect and change functions easily, and allow better optimization. It's also closer to normal GUI creation workflow.

Heres a list of more cool native features that you probably won't find anywhere else: 
- Jeff 2 has a built-in optimized hotkey system. Toggles (on-off) and Buttons (click to fire) let you bind hotkeys by right clicking them, so you don't have to implement expensive hotkey systems.
- Toggles and buttons can be **hidden** from user interaction. This prevents them from being fired, which is useful in case a module needs to wait for something to load or if an exploit doesn't support a function.
- Sliders are intuitive. Not only can you type in a specific number to jump to it, you can slow drag with right click to slowly change the value.
- Any object can have a description that appears when you mouse over it - called a tooltip - letting you quickly set descriptions without obstructing anything

Of course, this library isn't perfect and there are some issues.
- Although technically more than one window could be made, it is super buggy.
- Only a limited amount of menus can be made
- Library code is pretty large and not very polished
- Buttons, toggles, etc. take up a lot of space
- Generic ui design

Most of these issues will be worked on and fixed eventually.
 
### Loading the library
Just put this at the top of your script to load the library. It doesn't have to be called `ui`, but it will be here for consistency.
```lua
local ui = loadstring(game:HttpGet('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/topitbopit/rblx/main/ui-stuff/jeff_2.lua'))()
```



### Windows
In order to create the first window, begin with the `ui:NewWindow()` function.
```lua
local window = ui:NewWindow("EpicHax", 400, 300)
```
This would create a new window titled EpicHax with a size of 400 x 300, and assign it to `window`.

Now that the window is made, much more can be done.

The most important thing is creating a new menu. This lets you create buttons, sliders, and more
```lua
local menu = window:NewMenu("SpeedHax")
```
This will create a new menu called SpeedHax.

Although you can do more with windows such as being able to tell when they're minimized, that's pretty much it.
```lua
window.OnMinimize:Connect(function(min) print("Minimized:", min) end)
```
This will call an anonymous function that prints *Minimized: true* when minimized and *Minimized: false* when not minimized.

### Menus & Doing stuff

So now we have the first menu. How can you make it actually do stuff?
There's several objects you can create with menus.
The most simplest is a Label - used for displaying text.

```lua
menu:NewLabel("Text")
```
This would create a new text label displaying "Text".

Similar to a label, there's an object called a Section. It is essentially the same thing - even in code they're considered the same. The only difference is the size and position

*What about something that can do something cool?*

Here's a button. They have a single event called `OnClick` that gets fired, you guess it, on a click. 
```lua
local button = menu:NewButton("Do something!")

button.OnClick:Connect(function() 
	print("I did something!")
end)
```


**More explanations on how to create other objects will be added soon.**

### Finishing off

The most important part of your GUI is actually displaying it.
To do so with Jeff 2, just put this at the end of your script:
```lua
ui:Ready()
```
Because of the way jeff 2 internally works, objects can be created before ui:Ready() gets called very easily but will have many problems after the call.
**Do not create any objects after calling `:Ready()`**.

However, interactions with the ui or objects you've made are completely fine.
Sending a notification, messagebox, etc. or assigning a callback to an event won't mess anything up.

What about handling the ui close?
Maybe theres some important thing you want to delete or resources you want to clear out.

Using the `ui.Exiting` event, you can do this easily.
```lua
ui.Exiting:Connect(function() 
	for i,v in pairs(ClearLater) do
		v:Destroy()
	end
	ClearLater = nil
	

	for _, t in pairs(ui:GetAllToggles()) do 
		if t:GetState() == true then
			t:Disable()
		end
	end
	--cleanup successful
end)
```

> When exiting, every single object on screen gets closed automatically. However, no objects get disabled. To quickly disable toggles on close, use the `ui:GetAllToggles()` function and call `:Disable()` on each enabled toggle.

> Keep in mind that after the final window closes, all ui resources clear out automatically. If no window is created, the resources won't be cleared. To manually clear resources after you finish, use `ui:Exit()` **(NOT YET IMPLEMENTED)**

## UI
#### Creation:
```lua
local ui = loadstring(game:HttpGet('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/topitbopit/rblx/main/ui-stuff/jeff_2.lua'))()
```
*Loads the Jeff 2 library into `ui`*
#### Functions:

```lua
<void> ui:Ready()
```
*Readies library  `ui`, firing the `ui.OnReady` event.*
>`ui:Ready()` is important as it finalizes making the gui. Make sure to leave it at the far bottom of your script and **never** make more objects after calling `Ready()`. Assigning callbacks, displaying notifications and doing other things with the ui all work though.

```lua
<void> ui:SetColors(<variant> theme)
```
*Sets the ui color scheme to `theme`. Call before creation of any objects.*
*Available pre-made color schemes:*
|name|description|
|-|-|
|red|Near black colors with a red accent
|green|Dark gray colors with bright green accent
|blue|Similar to default, but higher contrast
|purple|Combination of Red and Blue
|bright|The closest theme to a light mode
|mono|All gray colors, better version of older bright
|mint|Like blue and bright
|legacy|Similar color scheme to the original jeff ui
|cold|Similar to blue and legacy
|nightshift|All black with some blueish/purple
|jacko|Black and orange
|spring|Slightly lighter version of mint with a different hue

<br/>

**All of the object types below have / will have their own dedicated sections on how to use them.**
```lua
<window> ui:NewWindow(<string> title, <number> size_x, <number> size_y)
```
*Creates a new window object.*

```lua
<msgbox> ui:NewMessagebox(<string> msg_text, <string> msg_desc, <table> msg_buttons)
```

```lua
<table> ui.Windows
```
*A table for ui windows. Used internally, do not change.*

<br/>

## Windows
Windows are pretty self explanatory. Note that although you can create more than one window, it is buggy and will not work well.

#### Creation:
```lua
<window> ui:NewWindow(<string> title, <number> size_x, <number> size_y)
```
*Creates a new window object named `title` with dimensions of (`size_x`, `size_y`)*
```lua
local window = ui:NewWindow("Example window", 400, 300)
```
*Creates a window called **Example window** thats 400 pixels wide and 300 tall*
#### Functions:
```lua
<menu> window:NewMenu(<string> menu_title, <bool> menu_showtitle = true)
```
*Creates a new menuobject named `menu_title`. If `menu_showtitle` is true, the menu header is displayed.*
>Scroll to the menu section to view more documentation on menus.

```lua
<bool> window:GetMinimized()
```
*Returns true if the window is minimized - false if not*
```lua
<table> window:GetMenus()
```
*Returns every menu. May be reworked later*
<br/>
#### Events:
```lua
<RBXEvent> window.OnMinimize
```
*Event that gets fired the current minimize state on change*

#### Variables:

`none`

<br/>

## Menus

Menus are important for actually creating your script. There technically can be any amount of menus, but you should use 1 - 6. 
#### Creation:
```lua
<menu> window:NewMenu(<string> menu_title, <bool> menu_showtitle = true)
```
*Creates a new menuobject named `menu_title`. If `menu_showtitle` is true, the menu header is displayed.*
```lua
local menu = window:NewMenu("Epic modules")
```
*Creates a menu displaying the header `Epic Modules`*
#### Functions:
```lua
<table> menu:GetChildren()
```
*Returns a table of all the menus children. Used internally, do not change*
```lua
<number> menu:GetChildrenCount()
```
*Returns how many children the menu has. Used internally, do not change*
**All below functions have specific documentation sections on how to use them. Scroll down until you find what you need!**
```lua
<section> menu:NewSection(<string> section_text)
```
*Creates a new section object saying `section_text`.*
```lua
<label> menu:NewLabel(<string> label_text)
```
*Creates a new label object saying `label_text`.*
>Although labels and sections are technically different, their functions are the exact same.
```lua
<toggle> menu:NewToggle(<string> toggle_text)
```
*Creates a new toggle object displaying `toggle_text`.*
>Older ui versions have a bool for enabling the toggle on creation, but it is deprecated and removed from newer versions.
```lua
<button> menu:NewButton(<string> button_text)
```
*Creates a new button object displaying `button_text`.*
```lua
<textbox> menu:NewTextbox(<string> tb_text, <bool> clearonfocus = true)
```
*Creates a new textbox object displaying `tb_text`. When `clearonfocus` is set to true, text will be cleared on focus. Currently, `clearonfocus` being false leaves it on.*
>The bool `clearonfocus` is currently broken. Use the function `tb:SetClearOnFocus` until it gets fixed.
```lua
<slider> menu:NewSlider(<string> slider_text, <number> slider_min = 0, <number> slider_max = 0, <number> slider_start = slider_min)
```
*Creates a new slider object displaying `slider_text` when unfocused, with a range from `slider_min` to `slider_max`, defaulting to `slider_start`.*
>Sliders are quite advanced and have lots of features. Right clicking will slow-drag, and entering a number into the value box will instantly set the slider to that value!
```lua
<dropdown> menu:NewDropdown(<string> dropdown_text, <table<string>> dropdown_options)
```
*Creates a new dropdown object displaying `dropdown_text`, with `dropdown_options` as options.*
```lua
<grid> menu:NewGrid()
```
*Unused as of now. Will be used as an embedded menu that can be used to fit more objects into a grid*
```lua
<void> menu:NewTrim()
```
*Creates a new trim object, which is the detail line below menu headers.*

#### Events:
```lua
<RBXEvent> menu.OnChildAdded
```
*Event that fires when a new child is added to a menu. Used internally, do not change.*

#### Variables:
`none`
<br/>

## Labels

Labels are useful for adding descriptions, and adding newline breaks (:NewLabel()). Descriptions for specific objects that can be viewed when you mouse over will be added soon.
#### Creation:
```lua
<label> menu:NewLabel(<string> text = "")
```
*Creates a new label reading `text` and returns it*
```lua
local Description = speedhax:NewLabel("Among us")
```
*Creates a new label reading **Among us**, and returns it to Description*
#### Functions:
```lua
<void> label:SetText(<string> newtext)
```
*Sets `label`s text to `newtext`*
```lua
<string> label:GetText()
```
*Returns `label`s text*
#### Events:
`none`
#### Variables:
`none`

<br/>

## Section

Sections are like labels, but with different positioning and sizing. They're the same as menu titles, but without the color gradient.

#### Creation:
```lua
<section> menu:NewSection(<string> text = "")
```
*Creates a new section reading `text` and returns it*
```lua
local Title = epicstuff:NewSection("TPHax")
```

<void> section:SetText(<string> newtext)
```
*Sets `section`s text to `newtext`*
```lua
<string> section:GetText()
```
*Returns `section`s text*
#### Events:
`none`
#### Variables:
`none`

<br/>

## Textbox

Textboxes are useful for user input. They're limited for now but will have more features and possibly a combined version with dropdowns.

#### Creation:
```lua
<textbox> menu:NewTextbox(<string> textbox_display, <boolean> textbox_clear)
```
*Creates a new textbox object displaying `textbox_display`. If `textbox_clear` is true, then the box will clear on focus*

```lua
local plrbox = teleports:NewTextbox("Enter player to teleport to")
```
*Creates a new textbox (`plrbox`) displaying `Enter player to teleport to`*

#### Functions:
```lua
<void> textbox:SetText(<string> text)
```
*Sets `textbox`s text to `text`*
```lua
<void> textbox:ForceFocus()
```
*Forces the client to focus on `textbox`*
```lua
<void> textbox:ForceRelease()
```
*Forces the client to unfocus `textbox`*
```lua
<void> textbox:SetClearOnFocus(<boolean> newstate)
```
*Sets `textbox`s ClearTextOnFocus property to `newstate`

```lua
<bool> textbox:IsFocused()
```
*Returns whether or not `textbox` is focused*
```lua
<string> textbox:GetText()
```
*Returns `textbox`s text*
```lua
<number?> textbox:GetTextFormattedAsInt()
```
*Returns `textbox`s text formatted as a number.*
> If the text cannot be formatted as a number properly, it returns `nil`. It may not return floats properly, so this tip will be updated when floats are confirmed to work.

```lua
<void> textbox:SetTooltip(<string> newtooltip)
```
*Sets this objects tooltip to `newtooltip`
```lua
<string> textbox:GetTooltip()
```
*Returns this object's tooltip*

#### Events:
```lua
<RBXEvent> textbox.OnFocusGained
```
*Event that fires when the textbox gains focus.*
```lua
<RBXEvent> textbox.OnFocusLost
```
*Event that fires when the textbox loses focus.*

#### Variables:
`none`
<br/>

## Button

Buttons are very simple but do have some neat features. Just like toggles, buttons natively support binds when right clicked.
Another cool feature buttons and toggles have is that they can be disabled from user interaction, or **hidden**. This prevents the user from actually clicking this button, which is useful in case a module needs to wait for something to load or if an exploit doesn't support a function.

#### Creation:
```lua
<button> menu:NewButton(<string> text)
```
*Creates a new `button` displaying `text`*
```lua
local invite = menu_amongus:NewButton("Join the discord server")
```
*Creates a button saying `Join the discord server` and assigns it to `invite`*

#### Functions:
```lua
<void> button:Fire()
```
*Triggers the OnClick function*
```lua
<void> button:SetCallback(<function> func)
```
*Sets the callback to `func`. Deprecated, will be removed within the next few updates*
```lua
<void> button:SetBind(<string?> bind_name)
```
*Sets `button`s bind to `bind_name`. If `bind_name` is not passed, the bind is removed.
>`bind_name` must be the name of the keycode you are binding. Instead of Enum.KeyCode.RightControl, pass "RightControl" or Enum.KeyCode.RightControl.Name
```lua
<string> button:GetBind()
```
*Returns the name of the bind `button` is bound to*

```lua
<void> button:SetText(<string> text)
```
*Sets `button`s text to `text`*
```lua
<string> button:GetText()
```
*Returns `button`s text*
```lua
<void> button:Hide(<string> message)
```
*Hides `button`, disabling user interaction. When hidden, `message` will be displayed.*
```lua
<void> button:Unhide()
```
*Unhides `button`, reenabling user interaction.*
```lua
<void> button:Assert(<string> global)
```
*Hides `button` with the message `Your exploit doesn't support global` if `global` is not found in the global env.*
>`:Assert()` was based on the vanilla function `assert`. If you pass a global, such as`getsynasset`, into `:Assert()` and that global is not found in `getgenv`, it will hide the object.

)
```lua
<void> button:SetTooltip(<string> newtooltip)
```
*Sets this objects tooltip to `newtooltip`
```lua
<string> button:GetTooltip()
```
*Returns this object's tooltip*
```lua
<boolean> button:IsMouseOver()
```
*Returns if the mouse is currently hovering over this object.*



#### Events:

```lua
<RBXEvent> button.OnClick
```
*Event that fires when clicked*

#### Variables:
```lua
<boolean> button.Hidden
```
*True when the button is hidden from interaction, false when it's not hidden*

## Toggle

Toggles are like advanced buttons. They can be hidden, have tooltips, and have binds, but can also be enabled, disabled, and toggled. 

#### Creation:
```lua
<toggle> menu:NewToggle(<string> text)
```
*Creates a new `toggle` displaying `text`*
```lua
local spectate = PlayerViewer:NewToggle("view selected player")
```
*Creates a toggle saying `view selected player` and assigns it to `spectate`*

#### Functions:
```lua
<bool> toggle:GetState()
```
*Returns true if `toggle` is enabled, false otherwise*
```lua
<void> toggle:SetState(<bool> newstate, <bool> call_func_after)
```
*Sets the state to `newstate`. If `call_func_after` is true, then the callback will be fired. **Currently broken, do not use.***
```lua
<void> toggle:Toggle()
```
*Toggles the toggle `toggle`, toggling the `OnToggle` `toggle` event*
```lua
<void> toggle:Enable()
```
*Enables `toggle`, firing the `OnEnable` and `OnToggle` events*

```lua
<void> toggle:Disable()
```
*Disables `toggle`, firing the `OnDisable` and `OnToggle` events*


```lua
<void> toggle:SetBind(<string?> bind_name)
```
*Sets `toggle`s bind to `bind_name`. If `bind_name` is not passed, the bind is removed.*
>`bind_name` must be the name of the keycode you are binding. Instead of Enum.KeyCode.RightControl, pass "RightControl" or Enum.KeyCode.RightControl.Name

)
*Image showcasing a toggle bound to E*
```lua
<string> toggle:GetBind()
```
*Returns the name of the bind `toggle` is bound to*

```lua
<void> toggle:SetText(<string> text)
```
*Sets `toggle`s text to `text`*
```lua
<string> toggle:GetText()'
```
*Returns `toggle`s text*

```lua
<void> toggle:Hide(<string> message)
```
*Hides `toggle`, disabling user interaction. When hidden, `message` will be displayed.*
```lua
<void> toggle:Unhide()
```
*Unhides `toggle`, reenabling user interaction.*
```lua
<void> toggle:Assert(<string> global)
```
*Hides `toggle` with the message `Your exploit doesn't support global` if `global` is not found in the global env.*
>Think of `:Assert()` like `if not getgenv()["global"] then toggle:Hide("Your exploit does not support global!") end`; it checks if the function / library exists and if it doesn't, it disables the toggle
```lua
<void> toggle:SetTooltip(<string> newtooltip)
```
*Sets this objects tooltip to `newtooltip`*
```lua
<string> toggle:GetTooltip()
```
*Returns this object's tooltip*
```lua
<boolean> toggle:IsMouseOver()
```

```lua
<RBXEvent> toggle.OnToggle
```
*Event that fires when toggled; true when enabled and false when disabled*


#### Variables:
```lua
<boolean> toggle.Hidden
```
*True when the toggle is hidden from interaction, false when it's not hidden*

## Dropdown
Dropdowns are useful for more specific customization, such as what method a flight script would use to fly.
![](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/892261816141496351/903425543104512090/unknown.png)
#### Creation:
```lua
<dropdown> menu:NewDropdown(<string> text, <table<string>> options)
```
*Creates a new dropdown displaying `text` with options `options`*
```lua
local speedmethod = m_speedhacks:NewDropdown("Speed hack method", {"CFrame","Walkspeed","Velocity"})
```
*Creates a new dropdown `speedmethod` saying `Speed hack method` with the options `CFrame`, `Walkspeed`, and `Velocity`.*

#### Functions:

```
*Sets `dropdown`s text to `text`*

```lua
<string> dropdown:GetText()
```
*Gets `dropdown`s text*
```lua
<string>, <number> dropdown:GetSelectedOption()

```lua
<string>, <number> dropdown:GetSelection()
```
*Alias for `GetSelectedOption()`*
```lua
<void> dropdown:SetSelectedOption(<variant>)
```
*Selects an option on the dropdown. Using the index is faster and preferable, but using the name works as well.*

```lua
<void> dropdown:Select()
```
*Alias for `SetSelectedOption()`*

```lua
<table> dropdown:GetOptions()
```
*Returns the dropdown options*
```lua
<void> dropdown:SetOptions()

```lua
<RBXEvent> dropdown.OnToggle
```
*Event that fires `true` when the dropdown opens and `false` when closed.*

#### Variables:
`none`

## Slider

Sliders are useful for easily changing a value of something, and have plenty of features like slow dragging and the number box. The only limitation is a slider can only have whole, positive integers from 0 to 999. They may gain support for floats and >999 later.
For more specific numbers, use a textbox and `tonumber` the text, since`:GetTextFormattedAsInt` doesn't support floats yet.

#### Creation:
```lua
<slider> menu:NewSlider(<string> slider_text, <number> slider_min = 0, <number> slider_max = 100, <number> slider_start = slider_min)
```
*Creates a new slider object displaying `slider_text` when unfocused, with a range from `slider_min` to `slider_max`, defaulting to `slider_start`.*

```lua
local how_many_years_will = it_take_for:NewSlider("jeff hoops 3 to release:",5,500,500)
```
*Creates a new slider `how_many_years_will` parented to `it_take_for` saying `jeff hoops 3 to release:` ranging from `5` to `500`*
#### Functions:

![](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/892261816141496351/903423745769738240/unknown.png)

#### Events:

```lua
<RBXEvent> slider.OnValueChanged
```
*Event that fires when the value changes. The event gets passed with the slider value and 1 if MouseButton1 was used, 2 if MouseButton2 was used, or 3 if SetValue / number box was used.*

## Grid

Grid objects are like menus inside of menus, and are unfinished. Instead of buttons, dropdowns, sliders, etc. being 100% the width of menus, they can be 1/3, 2/3, or 3/3 the width.

I.e., grids help you organize buttons like guis using jeff 1.
